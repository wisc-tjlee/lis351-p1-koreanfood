				Budae Jjigae (Army Stew) is also another dish that is on the menu at almost every traditional Korean restaurant inside and outside of Korea. It has varying ingredients that makes this dish a type of fusion cuisine which has now become a comfort food for Koreans. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Despite not have a long history, this dish symbolizes a grim time in Korean history. After the Korean War had ended, the country was impoverished and citizens were left with extra foods/ingredients on U.S. military bases. With this interesting assortment of ingredients, the Korean people created this so called army stew. Although this dish represents a time of poverty, the stew persists to be one of the most popular stews.
