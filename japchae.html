				Japchae is a dish that is very well known inside and outside of Korea. It is really difficult to not be seen on the menu.
				<br>
				<br>
				Japchae is loved by many for both its savory and sweet flavors. It is sometimes offered as a side dish, but is usually served as a main dish with its own or served on a bowl of rice. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Japchae has always been considered a royal dish, meaning that it was a common dish for the royal family during the Joseon dynasty. This dish has continued to be served at special occasions, such as birthdays and holidays, leading it to become a really popular dish because it can be easily modified and easily prepared on a large scale.

				The most basic version of Japchae, with a soy sauce based marinade, consists of a combination of the following: glass noodles, carrots, spinach, beef strips, green onion, bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms.
				<br>
				<br>
				The soy sauce flavors (with added sugar and sesame oil) makes this dish salty, sweet, and savory. These mild flavors, along with the fact that the ingredients can easily be substituted, help make it an approachable dish even for foreigners.
